So, using the video game Transistor as an example in this, I will go through and change some of the variables that make up some of
the various enemies and weapons. I will first show how the code was before, and then after, I have touched it up. 
By doing this, I can change how difficult or easy the game will be. I can also stress test to see what could cause crashes, and see the
varitable limitations of what can be processed.

    This, being the base "vanilla" code for the attack you can use from the start of the game, shows the variables for such things as
      -Damage
      -Charge Time
      -Projectile count and spread
      -ETC
    It also has the file paths for the animations and sounds used while using it. Personally I do not have any other files or know how
    to change this file path or what could be used other than the norm.
    Now, let's say we want to have this have more than the 1 projectile it already has, and then adjust it so it is more of a "Cone" 
    effect I would take these lines and change them as such:
    
    NumProjectiles="5"
    ProjectileAngleOffset="25"
    
    Now the ingame attack "Crash" is a fan of 5 projectiles in a short distance attack. Depending on user, the variables for StaminaCost
    can be either increased or decreased, in case you want easy mode or hard mode. A lower StaminaCost variable will allow it to be used
    more in a sequence than if you have a higher variable. If set to 0, it can be used an infinite number of times (which could also 
    lead to an over flow of data variables) or it can be increased, thus making it a more "balanced" in some views.
